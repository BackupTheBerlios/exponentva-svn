ALL(Exponent VA)
-major cleanup of naming conventions, coding styles, API sanity is required
-redesign stuff to be smarty based
1)php form controls
2)themes
3)pathos/exponent system messages (error, maintenance etc.)
4)in short: everything exponent displays should go through the same template engine pipeline
 
-perhaps integrate some database abstraction engine ?
-factor out common components that are repeatedly used in the modules, standardize functionality
